# While Loop 
# ==================

# This is used to execute a block of codes multiple times. It is also useful for writing interactive programs

# The Syntax 

# While <condition> :
#     <...block of code>
#     <an incremental value> {NB this line code prevents the loop statement from looping forever. so it is very much needed}

# example
# x=1
# while x<5:
#     print(x)
#     x=x+1
